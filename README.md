Android-Webservices

In this tutorial we demonstrate how to integrate android php into your app.We show how to issue HTTP requests to a php service and how to parse the JSON strings we get in the response. We also look at how to properly code this up in Android's AsyncTasks so the fetch happens in the background. Finally, we look at how to render the fetched data in a custom Adapter. see the tutorial in youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlGcnve_fOU&list=PL7kYps22_SCwJsqpRuj7yHKbEEk2S22CG
